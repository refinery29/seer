# Seer, a continuous integration harness

Seer is designed to facilitate continuous integration via a single configuration file. This file may be used to run steps of the continous integration in any environment, allowing developers to run the same steps which are run during the upstream CI process. The configuration file aims to be compatible with Travis CI config files.

## Configuration File

Currently only a scripts section is supported.
